 <img class="xr_ap" src="index_html_files/1420.jpg" alt="No matter what your situation, water extraction needs to be completed quickly and correctly to prevent severe structural damage and health-threatening mould growth. TIP: The first step you should take when dealing with any water damage situation is to stop the cause of the flooding. Often, you can quickly achieve this by turning off the main water supply tap to your premises.  After shutting off your water, you should call our emergency services team on 1800 739 867 (1800 REZTOR) to perform a water damage assessment, create a custom-for-you plan and extract/remove the freestanding water. Did you know that trying to extract water yourself can be dangerous? Water that has entered your home may be contaminated with life-threatening bacteria, mould or even toxins from metal corrosion. People often don’t realize how dangerous water can be. For example, flood water is always considered contaminated and should only be handled by professionals. No matter where the water came from, it is critically important to call a professional team to handle the situation. We have the proper equipment and expertise to handle any type of water issue - from clean water to black water, we’ve got you covered.

You’re also at a much higher risk for dangerous mould growth in your property due to the increased moisture level from water exposure.  Water extraction can only remove part of the water, and it will not eliminate mould, bacteria or mildew growth. Water damage can be devastating if you don’t take it seriously and call the right team. It’s important to call a professional, certified team that is prepared to handle any and all aspects of the problem for you - as soon as possible!  *If you want to know exactly how water damages your property over the first 72+ hours of water exposure, Click Here to be taken further down the page to our interactive “Water Damage Time Frame” outline Our process is designed and tested to eliminate any water problem and completely restore any property as quickly and efficiently as possible Choosing Reztor Restoration Can Save Your Property (And Your Time)!   When we first arrive at your property, we will assess the damage and formulate a custom progression plan. We will take photographs, moisture readings, and use thermal imagery to document the situation so that you have all information at hand in the event your insurance company requires it. The water damage assessment will help us fully understand what needs to be done to fix the problem for you. Once we complete the assessment you will be informed of everything our technicians found as well as the custom plan (which includes any services you may need done).  Our technicians will assist with careful movement/foam blocking of furniture to reduce secondary damage. We will then begin the water removal process as soon as possible, using our professional extraction equipment. We remove as much liquid water as possible during this process; however, water extraction alone will not remove all the water, and additional structural drying steps are required. Any affected furnishings, carpet, or flooring and the structure itself may need to be dried and restored to minimise water damage. You can learn more about Structural Drying by clicking here.
